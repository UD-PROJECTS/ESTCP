The cross-shore model CSHORE was developed initially to predict the
cross-shore transformation of irregular nonlinear waves using the timeaveraged continuity, momentum, and wave energy equations together with
a non-Gaussian probability distribution of the free surface elevation.
The empirical formulas of limited generality were required to
parameterize the wave nonlinearity. CSHORE is
based on linear wave theory and the Gaussian probability distribution to
reduce the degree of empiricism (Kobayashi et al. 1998; Kobayashi and
Johnson 1998; Johnson and Kobayashi 1998; Kearney and Kobayashi
2000; Johnson and Kobayashi 2000). Users can refer to `ERDC/CHL TR-12-22  <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA568508.pdf>`_
