Tyndall Air Force Base is located near Panama City on the Gulf coast of Florida. The majority of the base is located on a strip of land between two inland bays. A low-lying barrier island is located seaward with a low sloping wide continental shelf. Tide range is roughly 1 m with weak wave conditions except during extreme events. The base is highly susceptible to bay side flooding from storm surge.
